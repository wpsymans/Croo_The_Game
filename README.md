# Croo_The_Game
Croo WBC Hiking Boardgame
Croo is a cooperative boardgame where 2 to 6 players form a hiking crew with the objective of having fun, summiting the peak and coming down safely.

Printing Crew
The board game is 18x12 to fit on the default Staples Color poster printing size. To print a copy, go to print services at Staples.com (https://www.staples.com/services/printing/), and upload the file. It will cost about $10 for a single printed copy. The size can be adjusted and there are services that will print on a game board if a more permanent board is desired. 

Printing Questions
The questions can be printed on double-sided paper. I printed on card stock through Staples.com to give the cards more stability. It was a few dollars. You can make more cards by copying the front and back card slides then editing the question.
To Do: The outcome of the questions should be modified to add some variety. 

Printing Rules
The rules are just normal 8.5x11 paper and should be printed normally.

Other materials
You'll need six pieces for players. I used small wooden end-caps (https://www.acehardware.com/departments/building-supplies/lumber-and-trim/dowels/5013123?store=03839&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqIm_BhDnARIsAKBYcmvjWFOOd6UGeUkCSji53evfPR5yS7LDg8ZBw8DfZbWJDiAdwsu9ScQaAgHHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) and painted them different colors. There are lots of options. Sites such a https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/customized/game-pieces.html sell pieces in bulk if desired.

You'll need 10 Croo tokens. I just used unpainted wooden caps from above.

Finally, you'll need one die. These can be purchased or laying around most junk drawers.
